## 2. Performance Analysis

### 2.1 Propulsion Profile
* **Burn Time ($t_{burn}$):** 47 - 52s (Nominal: 50s)
* **Launch TWR:** 2.02
* **Total $\Delta V$:** ~ 1200 m/s 

### 2.2 Stability Analysis
Stability is achieved via passive aerodynamic forces.

* **Center of Mass (CoM):** Shifts forward during burn (Stable trend).
* **Center of Pressure (CoP):** Located at tail fins, behind the CoM
* **Static Margin:** Positive throughout flight.

## 3. Subsystem Design

### 3.1 Payload
* **Science Core:** 1st Generation Science Core - total mass 0.3 kg.
* **Sensors:** Barometer & Temperature.
* **Power:** Internal battery - total mass 0.3 kg.
* **Recovery:** None.

### 3.2 Power
* **Load:** 102 W (Avionics + Comms).
* *Supply:** 30 kJ Internal Chemical Battery.

### 3.3 Communications (RF Link)
Analysis of the 2W UHF downlink to Ground Station (G/S).

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tx Power** | +30 dBm |
| **Tx Gain** | 1.5 dBi |
| **Rx Gain** | +3 dBi |
| **Path Loss** | -105.1 dB |
| **Received Power ($P_{RX}$)** | **-70.6 dBm** |

* **Noise Floor:** -131.4 dBm
* **Link Margin:**
    $$-70.6 - (-131.4) = \mathbf{+60.7 \text{ dB}}$$
* **Verdict:** Link is sufficient.

### 3.4 Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC)
* **Active Control:** None.
* **Passive Stabilisation:** Tail fins angled at 5 degrees, generating spin stabilisation from aerodynamic forces.

## 4. Risk Register
| Serial | Risk | Mitigatation | Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Uncontrolled catastrophic failure (explosion) | All personnel to be clear of pad. | High |
| 2 | Engine failure | Engines are static tested prior to flight. | Medium |
| 3 | Debris striking personnel or structres | Vehicle to be launched at a small angle towards the sea. Range safety device to be installed if possible. | Medium |

## 5. Manufacturing and Launch Constraints
* LC-1 being developed with ground support equipment (GSE) for handling fuels for Skybreaker. Currently under construction - due
to complete February 1951
* Vehicle must be launched east over the Atlantic.
